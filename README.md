# FaceRecognition_opencv

This project is a simple implementation of **real-time face detection** using **OpenCV** and the **Haar Cascade classifier** (`haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml`).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects human faces from a webcam feed in real time
- Uses OpenCV's built-in Haar cascade detection model
- Great starting point for learning computer vision with Python

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satyaabdul/FaceRecognition_opencv.git
cd FaceRecognition_opencv
```

---

### 2. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
---

### 3. Download Haar Cascade XML File

Download haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml and place it in the same folder as main.py.

---

### 4. Run the Program

```bash
python main.py
```

Press q to quit the webcam window.



---

### Notes
- Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible
